PyVim Help
==========

PyVim is a Pure Python Vim Clone.


Thanks to:
    - Pyflakes: the tool for checking Python source files for errors.
    - Jedi: the Python autocompletion library.
    - Pygments: Python syntax highlighter.
    - prompt_toolkit: the terminal UI toolkit.

Keybinds in autocompletion
------------------------------

When editing Python with Jedi enabled, an autocomplete window appears and follows these key bindings

- Ctrl+n: select next candidate
- Ctrl+p: select previsous candidate
- Tab: close autocompletion window
- Escape: cancel completion and close autocompletion window

This key binding may change in the future.

More help and documentation will follow."""
